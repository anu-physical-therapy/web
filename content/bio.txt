Áine (pronounced “Awn-ya”) completed her Physiotherapy degrees in the UK - with a Master of Science in Physiotherapy from University College London; and, a Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy at the University of Brighton.  

Following post-graduate training in orthopaedics, she became a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Physiotherapists.   Having done a Masters thesis on how bone reacts to weight-bearing, she has  a special interest in treatment of osteopenia,  osteoporosis and vertebral fractures; and is certified in both BoneFit and OsteoCircuit to treat these conditions.


She loves working with people who have been diagnosed* with low bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, or fragility fractures through a personalised rehabilitation program designed for return of functional ability, balance retraining and falls prevention; and resisted exercises based on the latest Clinical Practice Guidelines for Osteoporosis care and rehabilitation.


If you are frightened to move after your fracture experience, she will gently guide you through your rehabilitation stages, at your own pace, with a program based on a comprehensive initial OsteoCircuit assessment and with your specific goals and needs in mind.


Outside of work, Áine enjoys long hikes with her dogs, sailing, knitting, and watching Canada win at hockey!
